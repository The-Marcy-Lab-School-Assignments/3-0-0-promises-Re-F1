# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
`Outside promise` will be printed first. This is because synchornous operation will be done first. The `console.log('Outside promise')` does not need to wait for a resolve - it is just simply printed. 

`Inside promise` will be printed after the promise is resolved, hence the  `.then()`. There is an asynchronous operation being set up
