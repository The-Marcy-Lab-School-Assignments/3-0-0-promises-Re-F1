# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
`.then` is ran when the promise is resolved, or fulfilled.

`.catch` will be initiated if the promise is rejeted. As it will catch the error if it is being thrown

For both `.then()` and `.catch()` : 
> Chain to a promise
>
> Both methods return a promise

This is solid! Just remember that they both also take Callback functions.
