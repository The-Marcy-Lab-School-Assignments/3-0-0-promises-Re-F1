# Question
With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling *and* returning them

# Answer
**a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`**

<ins>Reasoning</ins>:
Calling resolve() or reject() would produce a value. This is because when we do resolve() in our promise it changes the promise value from pending to fulfilled. When we do reject () in our promise it changes pending to rejected
