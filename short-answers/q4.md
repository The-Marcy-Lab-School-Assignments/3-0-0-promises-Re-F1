# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
The argument `resolve` is ran when the promise is resolved, or fulfilled
The argument `reject` is when the promise is rejected, uses the catch method and returns to the user

Answer was mostly correct. Just want to point out some technical communication you can fix.

Saying invoke, or call(ing) a function, is a better way of saying you are "running a function" or the functions "ran".

The passed in values are the resolved value and the rejected value.
